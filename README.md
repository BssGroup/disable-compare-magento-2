## 2. How to install

- **Step 1**: Unzip the file.
- **Step 2**: Create another directory called app/code/Bss/MODULENAME/ where MODULENAME must be replaced by the modules internal identifier. You can find it in the "composer.json" file in the extension ZIP file you downloaded, look at the node "psr-4". For example, it could say "Bss\\AjaxCart\\" or "Bss\\OneStepCheckout\\" there, then the MODULENAME is the part after \\ and before \\, so in our examples AjaxCart" or "OneStepCheckout". 
This is what you call the directory, then, for example app/code/Bss/AjaxCart, and you put the contents of the extension ZIP file in there. 
- **Step 3**: Upload the directory app/code/Bss/MODULENAME/ into the root directory of your Magento installation. The root directory of Magento is the directory that contains the directories "app", "bin", "lib" and more. All directories should match the existing directory structure. 
- **Step 4**: Go to Magento 2 root directory. Run: php bin/magento setup:upgrade.
- **Step 5**: Run: php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy.
- **Step 6**: Clear all caches.
